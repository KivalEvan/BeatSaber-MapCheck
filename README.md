# Beat Saber Map Check
A small project to bring extensive overview of maps,
aimed to reduce the error before modding & map release.

by **Kival Evan#5480**

## Features
Map tools to spot specific error, and map stats per each difficulty in one place.

## How to use
Visit the [github.io page](https://kivalevan.github.io/BeatSaber-MapCheck/) or download a copy and run `index.html` locally on any browser. Tools available within collapsible.

## Limitations
* DD check does not care about bomb reset
* No map modification outside base game support (Mapping Extension, Noodle Extension, etc.)

## Planned
* Basic parity check
* Basic unrankable hit check
* Bomb reset detection
* Crouch wall detection
* More extensive stats

## Known Issues
* Due to pepega that is MediocreMapper BPM change, it may not show correct beat numbering

## Note
Since this is my first ever (web) project, I'm open to feedback to further improve skill and develop better stuff in the future. If you have any suggestion or feedback, let me know on Discord@Kival Evan#5480
